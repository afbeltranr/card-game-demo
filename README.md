# 🃏 Card Game Demo Project

Welcome to the **Card Game Demo** project! This project aims to build a simple yet engaging card game using Python. The focus is on creating a text-based game that can later be expanded with a dynamic dashboard for visualizations and potentially multiplayer functionality. 

## 🎯 Project Overview
In this card game, players draw from either a **pile of unknown cards** or a **pile of known discarded cards**. The goal is to **achieve the lowest score** based on the values of cards in hand, with special scoring rules for certain cards:

- Red King ♔ = 0 points
- Black King ♚ = 20 points
- Other cards = their face value (e.g., 2-10, J, Q)

The game includes a special rule for **cutting turns**, where a player can interrupt the next player if they have a matching card.

## 📚 PACE Methodology
This project follows the **PACE** methodology, which ensures a structured approach to development:

### 1. 📝 Plan
- Define game rules, mechanics, and objectives.
- Set up a **GitHub repository** and environment for development.
- Outline clear **milestones** and **goals** for each stage.
